Pol.is calculations are made automatically and visualized as you vote and submit comments. As you vote, you will move closer to people who have voted like you did. Once you finish voting, you can explore where you fell relative to everyone else. You can explore opinions by groups, in this way minority opinions are not lost. You can also see the majority opinion.
