title: "How do I fill out a survey"
description: 'Contribute your opinion by taking a survey. Take a survey for your district or a broad topic such as "How to Fix the MTA" or "Affordable Housing."'
hero: "You can answer a survey in 3 simple steps."

## Step 1

Access the survey on web or mobile via the survey link.


## Step 2

For each comment you can vote to agree/disagree/pass. Remember, you are being asked for your personal opinion, your personal experience is what counts here.


## If you feel your perspective isn't already represented

Add your own comment in the 'Share your perspective' space at the bottom of the page.

# What makes an effective comment?

The most effective comments include an expression of what you feel and why you feel it. We encourage you to express your opinions freely!

Remember, one person with some new information, a relevant personal experience, or a good idea will have more impact on the outcome than 1,000 people who just say they agree or disagree with an issue.


For additional guidelines on effective commenting please use [Cornell Regulation Room](http://regulationroom.org/learn/what-effective-commenting) as a resource. The Regulation Room gathers information for rulemaking and policies, however, there guidelines can be used for commenting in general (even in real life when arguing with a friend!)
