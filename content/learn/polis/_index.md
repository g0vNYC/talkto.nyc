Pol.is is an AI powered surveying tool that has been used to great success in countries like Taiwan and Denmark. It is easy to use and can obtain the sorts of rich, organic data that is usually obtained through community forums or interviews.

On Pol.is, you can vote to agree/disagree/pass on comments or enter their own comments. Machine intelligence, in this case unsupervised learning in the form of PCA and then K-means, produces opinion groups. These calculations are made automatically and visualized as you vote and submit comments. As you vote, you will move closer to people who have voted like you did. Once you finish voting, you can explore where you fell relative to everyone else. You can explore opinions by groups, in this way minority opinions are not lost. You can also see the majority opinion.

Whether you are a citizen, city official or organization, Pol.is is powerful tool for you to identity key issues and find a mutual foundation for further discussions and actions.


>Far from being techno-utopianism or moving us into some kind of a state where people no longer matter, machine learning can be used in representative democracy to bring more people's voices and more diverse voices into our regulation and policy, making policies more human because they are instructed by a greater section of society.
