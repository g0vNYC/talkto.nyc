# Project Background

Talk to NYC serves as a channel for accomplishing the following:

- using crowdsourcing to inform city decision making and election processes
- reducing the burden of participation for citizens and city officials while increasing effectiveness, by introducing innovative tools into city governance
- connecting organizations and districts around shared concerns to help solve them in a more effective way
- open tools and know-how for all; open data for all


## Our long-term goal is to build a viable city governance system.

g0vNYC is a test for set up self regulating viable systems, capable of incorporating feedback.  We define 'viable system' based on cybernetic management science, pioneered by Stafford Beer. A viable system is one that deals effectively with variety. For example: In order to function an administration needs to deal with citizen variety. For this to be achieved in a regulated manner, there needs to be a balance between the top-down and bottom-up processes. This balance is what g0vNYC is working on setting up.


## Team

We are a citizen scientist collective that operates at the intersection of design & technology, behavioral sciences, and society. We employ dynamic systems theories, analyses of social structures, and the science of design to transform organizations.
