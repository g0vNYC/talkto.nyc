As NYC gets ready for city elections this fall, city organizations are putting together nonpartisan forums in which candidates can address the issues that matter to community members. This survey is designed to inform candidates of NYC Council District 18 of the issues that matter to District 18 community members.

This survey matters to you if you 
1. live in NYC District 18 
2. work in NYC District 18
3. are a NYC District 18 council candidate 

By taking this survey
1. you can share your opinions and experiences with your candidates and community 
2. you can learn what your community is thinking and feeling

Citizens and district officials both have a stake in effective, responsible governance practices. Don't be a bystander — contribute your opinions in a meaningful way. Share what you know and encourage family, friends and coworkers to do the same.
