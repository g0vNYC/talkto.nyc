As NYC gets ready for city elections this fall, it is important that council candidates can address the issues that matter to their community members. This survey is designed to inform candidates of NYC Council District 2 of the issues that matter to District 2 community members.

This survey matters to you if you 

1. live in NYC District 2 
2. work in NYC District 2 and/or
3. are a NYC District 2 council candidate 

By taking this survey 

1. you can share your opinions and experiences with your candidates and community 
2. you can learn what your community is thinking and feeling

Citizens and district officials both have a stake in effective, responsible governance practices. Don't be a bystander â€” contribute your opinions in a meaningful way. Share what you know and encourage family, friends, and coworkers to do the same.
